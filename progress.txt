19/4 Tyler
- implement throwing random tokens for player in allowed area
- implemented board representation and updating throwing

20/4 Tyler
- Implemented updating board representation for sliding

21/4 Tyler
- Implemented token eating in board representation
- Successfully have to agent doing Random moves playing the game

22/4 Tyler
- Fixed logic error in updating board representation (updating board's move one by one)

23/4 Tyler
- Starting on heuristics of a state of a board, doing the heuristic for a single token first
- Planning on implementing a simple heuristic and get the algorithm going, and discuss the heuristic in more detail with
teammate and implement it.

24/4 Tyler
- Modified function for updating board to create a new state, to be used in creating child states in algorithm
- Create function to return all possible game stats from a single state of game

25/4 Tyler
- Manage the data and created a matrix for game theory to output the best option

26/4 Tyler
- Added throwing options to the matrix for game theory
- Current problem: Game would choose to throw a token as far as possible to get a good heuristic

28/4 Tyler
- refactored some functions to static functions
- Completed AI looking at all moves one step ahead

29/4 Tyler
- Multiple debugging of board updates and move returning
<<<<<<< HEAD

7/5 Tyler
- Add function to only consider good moves
    - Slide towards target
    - Slide away from predator
    - dont throw on ally

changed token_win function to static
